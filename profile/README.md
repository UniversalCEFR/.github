# UniversalCEFR: Enabling Open Multilingual Research on Language Proficiency Assessment

UniversalCEFR is a largescale, multilingual, multidimensional dataset comprising of texts annotated according to the [CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference)](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions). The collection comprises of a total of **505,807 CEFR-labeled texts** annotated according to the in **13 languages** in 4 script (Latin, Arabic, Devanagari, and Cyrillic).

 - English (en)
 - Spanish (es)
 - German (de)
 - Dutch (nl)
 - Czech (cs)
 - Italian (it)
 - French (fr)
 - Estonian (et)
 - Portuguese (pt)
 - Arabic (ar)
 - Hindi (hi)
 - Russian (ru)
 - Welsh (cy)

To enable open research in both automated readability and language
proficiency assessment, UniversalCEFR comprises curated from educational and learner-oriented resources, standardized into a unified data format to support consistent processing, analysis, and modeling across tasks and languages.

## Accessing UniversalCEFR 

The full informative data directory is listed in this repo: [`universalcefr-data-directory`](https://github.com/UniversalCEFR/universalcefr-data-directory).

If you're interested in a specific individual or group of datasets from UniversalCEFR, you may access or download their transformed, standardised version through the UniversalCEFR Huggingface Org: https://huggingface.co/UniversalCEFR

If you use any datasets indexed in UniversalCEFR, **please cite the original dataset papers** they are associated with. You can find them in the data directory repo.

Note that there are a few datasets in UniversalCEFR---`EFCAMDAT`, `APA-LHA`, and `DEPlain`---that are not directly available from the UniversalCEFR Huggingface Org as they require users to agree with their Terms of Use before using them for non-commercial research. Once you've done this, you can use the preprocessing Python scripts in `universal-cefr-experiments` repository to transform the raw version to UniversalCEFR version.

### How to Join?
We want to grow this community of researchers, language experts, and educators to further advance openly accessible CEFR/language proficiency assessment datasets for all. 

If you're interested in this direction and/or have open dataset/s you want to add to UniversalCEFR for better exposure and utility to researchers, please fill up this **[form](https://forms.office.com/e/hjd7ew0M8C)**. 

When we index your dataset to UniversalCEFR, we will cite you and the paper/project from which the dataset came across the UniversalCEFR platforms.
